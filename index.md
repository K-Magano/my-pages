title: Data Analytics for Beginners

---

I took on the role of a data analyst for NT CitiBikes and worked with a real dataset to solve a business challenge. 

I am now familiar with:

* Some of the key steps in the data analysis process.
  
* Understand, and able to apply, some fundamental analysis techniques.
  
* Have a first-hand glimpse of what itâ€™s like to work as a data analyst
* 

*Citi Bike is a real company. However, the project is purely hypothetical, created by us for the purpose of the short course ðŸ˜Š **Weâ€™ve sourced the data from a free data site: Kaggle.com and customized it to fit the scope of our project, adding in extra variables as well as excluding other variables. Please ONLY use the data in the link below, or other links provided for the short course and do not download the data from the Kaggle.com site***
